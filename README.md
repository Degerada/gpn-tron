## Helloooo!

My first attempt at a proper Rust program,  
so don't look here for best coding practices on Rust :D

## How to Run

If you want to run the program, inside the .cargo directory rename the config.toml.example to config.toml,  
and store some proper credentials.  
Then type cargo run to compile and execute it.
